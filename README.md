# FlexWebsite on PuTTY

Simple website using flexbox that I created using nginx server on PuTTY.

> (2024-06-21) -> Hosted on `pikachu.local` <br>
> File contained in `/var/www/html`

## Running nginx

After downloading nginx, run the start command
```ssh
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

And open up the index.html file using
```ssh
cd /war/www/html
sudo nano index.html
```

If there is not index.html, create one
```ssh
nano index.html
```
